Using AHK v1.1.24.04, 
- When using Windows UAC (User Account Control), causes the AltTab function working incorrectly and creating a sticky <alt> key.

AutoHotKey v2 is alpha-release. Suggest use v1.1.24.02

### Override (Disable All) Windows keys - https://autohotkey.com/docs/misc/Override.htm 
; http://www.askvg.com/tip-how-to-disable-all-win-keyboard-shortcuts-hotkeys-in-windows/

### Mouse, Reverse scrolling is disabled.
I'm using Wizmouse, becouse the scroll / focus option.
(Hovering over an inactive program scrolling works on that program )

- Has `WIN` key conflict when AHK with StartIsBack++. 
A suggest replace StartIsBack++ with Start10, or use system start.
